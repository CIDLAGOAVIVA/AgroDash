# **App Name**: AgriDash

## Core Features:

- Main Dashboard: Display a main dashboard with multiple pre-defined, simulated crop types, each with a simulated field name.
- Real-time Data Visualization: Show real-time (simulated) data visualizations for soil and air temperature, soil moisture, solar radiation, plant development stage and vegetation index.
- Animated Dynamic Graphs: Update charts and graphs automatically with streaming/continuous simulated data.
- Anomaly Alerts: Provide visual alerts for anomalies, such as 'Low moisture for soybeans' or 'High temperature in Field 2', based on reasonable thresholds. Use an LLM tool to make this determination.
- Visual History: Enable a simple visual history, displaying data evolution over the last few simulated hours or days.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Medium shade of green (#90EE90) to represent growth and nature, keeping it gentle.
